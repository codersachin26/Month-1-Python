## Week 2

Learn about good practices to write clean code and rework on Week 1 task in a OOPs way.

created a [**XConvertor**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_2/XConvertor/xconvertor.py) class,XConvertor object have methods to generate files from API data.

created classes for charts:-

- [**PieChart**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_2/charts_class/pie_chart.py)
- [**BarChart**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_2/charts_class/bar_chart.py)
- [**HistChart**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_2/charts_class/histogram_chart.py)

## Week 3

created a [**SqlDB**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_3/sql_db.py) class which deal with mysql server database.  

**SqlDB** methods:-
 - create_table()
 - drop_table()
 - check_table_exist()
 - create_table()
 - insert_into_table()
 - read_rows()
 - delete_row()
 - update_row()
 - is_connected()

Learn about unit testing and wrote test cases for [**SqlDB**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/blob/master/Week_3/test/test_sql_db.py) class.


## Week 4

Learn about unittest package and generate tests report and ziped, send it via Email.

written test cases for [**XConvertor**](https://github.com/codersachin26/Month-1-Python/tree/master/Week_2/XConvertor/test) class

Implement a function `send_email()` that send tests report.
